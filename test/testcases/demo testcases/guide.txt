test206 -> DCT 2D
test219 -> Covariance
test221 -> Convolution Layer for CNN
test223 -> Subtraction for face recognition
test225 -> Addition for face recognition
test227 -> Dimensionality restoration for face recognition
test262 -> Parallel version of test221
test280 -> Quantization with 1 DPU (Note that it doesn't make sense when we need more than one cell for RegFile, we only use one DPU of the cells.)
test281 -> Quantization with 2 DPUs
test282 -> Quantization with 4 DPUs
test283 -> RGB to YUV with 1 DPU
